# FONHakaton

This project was created as a part of FON Hackathon 2022. Task was to create application that draws Sierpinski triangle. We present two ways of drawing: first is classical approach with recursion, while second uses something that is called [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game).
To start application go to folder MainScreen/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1 and run MainScreen.exe.


_Code was done in C# in Visual Studio 2019 envrioment._
